# PCA
Attached notebook demonstrates how to use PCA.

Large datasets are increasingly widespread in many disciplines. In order to interpret such datasets, methods are required to drastically reduce their dimensionality in an interpretable way, such that most of the information in the data is preserved. Many techniques have been developed for this purpose, but principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the oldest and most widely used. Its idea is simple—reduce the dimensionality of a dataset, while preserving as much ‘variability’ (i.e. statistical information) as possible.

In this notebook I have shown,
* How to train a model without using Dimentionality Reduction.
* Performing Dimentionality Reduction without using SKLEARN.
* Performing Dimentionality Reduction with SKLEARN.
* Data Visualization after dimentionality reduction.
* Find Out the Optimal number of Principal Components
